	<h2>Welcome to the Hunter College CS syllabi directory!</h2>

	<p>This website will contain the syllabi for all computer science courses at Hunter College. Most of the syllabi here are for some of the undergraduate courses, but hopefully (through some crowdsourcing), we can get the syllabi for all undergraduate and graduate CS courses at Hunter</p>
